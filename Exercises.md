## Week 1


### Questions

#### What types of writing do you do (fiction, poetry, other)?

Lately I have been leaning more into prose poetry, but mostly I tend to write in fiction. 


#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

I use my notepad (and pen) first to scribble out ideas and then mostly use word to type things up and edit. I am also capable of Celtex script writing program.


#### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g, constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

I'd say I stick to the classic ways/techniques of writing as it's within my comfort zone and that would also be the largest constraint.
