# Exercises

## Week 1


### Questions

#### What types of writing do you do (fiction, poetry, other)?

Lately I have been leaning more into prose poetry, but mostly I tend to write in fiction. 


#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

I use my notepad (and pen) first to scribble out ideas and then mostly use word to type things up and edit. I am also capable of Celtex script writing program.


#### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g, constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

I'd say I stick to the classic ways/techniques of writing as it's within my comfort zone and that would also be the largest constraint. 


## Week 2



### Questions 

#### How is electronic literature different from print literature?

- Electronic literature has more forms that are unavailable to in-print lietrature. 
- Electronic literature can only ever exist in the digital scape, where as some print literature has the ability to exist within both realms. 
- Electronic literature is evolving more rapidly and equally becoming more obselete with the advancements of technology. 
- Electronic literature relies on computers/digital technology to exist. 

#### What are some of the qualities of electronic literature?

- There is more scope to be experimental without the limitations of in-print ratios/margins. 
- The interarctive aspect can be more exciting for readers. Allows for reader involvement. (The work becomes less about the author.) 

### Maria Engberg: Alone Engaged

[Alone Engaged](https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/alone_engaged/)

#### What aspects of the remix are the same?

- Text still appears on the left hand of the screen in the same infinite stream, with the same pacing.
- It has a tendency to use the same words in multiple lines, (i.e, Swedes, Lesbian, Homeless), like wise to Taroko Gorge's constant use of 'the crag.'

#### What aspects of the remix are different?

- It is not a nature poem, instead a queer/feminist poem. 
- The background is a different colour (yellow) to gague a different mood of content. 
- It feels more personable, not just computer generated words. 

#### Is the remix successful?

- In short yes, I believe it is successful. It takes all of the same principals of Taroko Gorge but reinvents it for a different subject (and in turn for a different/more diverse audience). The poem feels updated and relevant to the social/political topics it is dealing with. I argue that this remix is better suited to this form than the original.

### writing Hypertext Fiction

#### How is it different from fiction?

It is non- linear and the reader is not constrained to read it sequentially. Readers have options. 

#### How is it different from games?

Games are usually driven by objectives and the player cannot continue until objectives are achieved. Hypertext does not hinge itself on objectives, even if some people consider the objective of hypertext fiction to finish it. 

#### How do you plan fiction?

I'm not often someone who plans my writing, but I do keep phrases, quotes or words that I like in a notes document either on my phone or in a notebook. 

#### How could you plan hypertext fiction?

I liked the idea of mapping hypertext stories and their directions on platforms such as twine. 

# Week 6

- Added a photo to my twine story 'the carnival.'
- Made the photo linkable to a new room. 
- Changed the style sheet on twine. 
- Attempted (and failed) at inform 7. 

#### Reflection 

While I definitely struggled to import the photo into twine from my computer, learning through repetition has been the most efficent way for me to retain information. Doing the task multiple times, while time consuming, was important as this is the mechanism that will form the entirety of my final project. Once the image was imported and I felt more comfortable using twine as a platform to create my final project I went ahead and learnt how to link the image to a new room. Again this will be important as I plan on having clickable images/advertisements that will lead to poems. 

After the class tutorial and workshop, I used these same codes, but imported gifs rather than jpgs to achieve a more interactive and less static room that I plan on using for the final assessment. 

# Week 9

#### Documentation of Digital Literature vs Video Games

- Games tend to be objective based, where literature generally isn't. 
- The line between the two is generally pretty blurry and sometimes does not exist at all. i.e., it is possible for digital literature to be both game and literature. 
- There is an axis of interactivity and readability and most digital literature can be placed at some place along it. 
- Readers are ultimately the ones who decide what genre a piece will belong too. The audience is the only variable that the author cannot control. 

#### Exercises 

Added an audio file to the 'wake up' room in my experimental twine piece, 'The Carnival' (linked at week 5). 
- Much like adding a photo, the process of adding audio to twine was tricky and took me a few trys to execute. I found that the audio wouldn't add to the opening room. 
- I would like to learn if it is possible to change the volume and if there are other audio warping options.
