# Exercises

## Week 1


### Questions

#### What types of writing do you do (fiction, poetry, other)?

Lately I have been leaning more into prose poetry, but mostly I tend to write in fiction. 


#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

I use my notepad (and pen) first to scribble out ideas and then mostly use word to type things up and edit. I am also capable of Celtex script writing program.


#### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g, constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

I'd say I stick to the classic ways/techniques of writing as it's within my comfort zone and that would also be the largest constraint. 


## Week 2



### Questions 

#### How is electronic literature different from print literature?

- Electronic literature has more forms that are unavailable to in-print lietrature. 
- Electronic literature can only ever exist in the digital scape, where as some print literature has the ability to exist within both realms. 
- Electronic literature is evolving more rapidly and equally becoming more obselete with the advancements of technology. 
- Electronic literature relies on computers/digital technology to exist. 

#### What are some of the qualities of electronic literature?

- There is more scope to be experimental without the limitations of in-print ratios/margins. 
- The interarctive aspect can be more exciting for readers. Allows for reader involvement. (The work becomes less about the author.) 

### Maria Engberg: Alone Engaged

[Alone Engaged] (https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/alone_engaged/)

#### What aspects of the remix are the same?

- Text still appears on the left hand of the screen in the same infinite stream, with the same pacing.
- It has a tendency to use the same words in multiple lines. (i.e, Swedes, Lesbian, Homeless) 

#### What aspects of the remix are different?

- It is not a nature poem, instead a queer/feminist poem. 
- The background is a different colour (yellow) to gague a different mood of content. 
- It feels more personable, not just computer generated words. 

#### Is the remix successful?

- In short yes, I believe it is successful. It takes all of the same principals of Taroko Gorge but reinvents it for a different subject (and in turn for a different/more diverse audience). The poem feels updated and relevant to the social/political topics it is dealing with. I argue that this remix is better suited to this form than the original.
